--- DMI take-home coding assignment --- Matthew Riese ---

This was a fun challenge, thanks for the opportunity! I learned a lot!
I'm turning it in now (Friday 10/22/21) as is because it's been a week, but I intend to continue  working on the tests, which I just started working on, if only for my own practice.

My strategy was to tweak the default app in the boilerplate until it fit the requirements. I didn't bother removing all the code that I am not using anymore, but I might have worked on that if I had more time.

I gave it a Back To The Future theme, just for fun!

The server I built is in this repo: https://github.com/mattriese/react-boilerplate-backend

Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
